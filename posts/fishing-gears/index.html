Introduction
Over the years, I&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of experience in fishing, especially in selecting the right gear. Choosing the appropriate rod, reel, line, and lure can significantly impact your fishing success. In this blog, I want to share my insights to help you make informed decisions when selecting fishing equipment.
Rod Selection
Understanding Rod Actions

L (Light) Action Rods:

Best for casting lures weighing 4-5g.
Ideal for using lures within half of the rod&rsquo;s lure weight range (e.g., for a rod rated 2-7g, the optimal lure weight is around 4-5g).


UL (Ultra-Light) Action Rods:

Suitable for casting lures weighing 3g or less.



One-Piece vs. Multi-Piece Rods

One-Piece Rods:

Offer better sensitivity and casting performance.
However, they are less portable and harder to transport.
Not as easy to sell if you decide to upgrade.


Multi-Piece Rods:

More convenient for travel.
Slight trade-off in sensitivity compared to one-piece rods.



Recommended Action

The best action for spinning cast rods is Light (L) action.

Reel Selection
Spinning Reels vs. Baitcasting Reels

Spinning Reels:

Easier for casting, especially for beginners.
Better suited for saltwater fishing than baitcasting reels.
Can use heavier action rods to cast small lures effectively.


Baitcasting Reels:

Look cool and offer precision, but have a steeper learning curve.
Not as user-friendly for casting light lures.



Reel Size and Line Compatibility

For a 2500S reel:

0.8 PE line is sufficient.
Using 0.6 PE line on a 2500S reel may require too much line to fill the spool.


For a 2000S reel:

0.6 PE line is appropriate.


It&rsquo;s not common to use PE lines smaller than 0.6, as they are less widely available.

Light Weight Reels

Always choose lightweight reels for better balance and less fatigue during fishing.

Line Selection
PE Line vs. Fluorocarbon

Casting Difficulty:

1.5 PE and fluorocarbon lines offer similar casting challenges.


PE Line Advantages:

Thinner diameter for the same strength compared to fluorocarbon.
Essential for longer casting distances.


Avoiding Line Connections:

Use a Carolina rig to eliminate the need to connect PE line and fluorocarbon leader.



Recommended Lines

YGK PE Line:

Highly recommended for its quality.
Performs much better than Sufix lines.
Consider using 0.6 or 0.8 PE from YGK.


Fluorocarbon Line:

1.5 Fluorocarbon can be used as a leader if necessary.



Rigs and Lures

Carolina Rig:

Allows you to use PE line without needing to connect it to a fluorocarbon leader.
Effective for various fishing conditions.



Recommendations
Final Gear Choices

Rod:

L Action Spinning Rod with multiple pieces for portability.


Reel:

2000S or 2500S spinning reel, prioritize lightweight models.


Line:

0.6 or 0.8 YGK PE line (lean towards 0.6 for more capacity).
Optional 1.5 Fluorocarbon leader.


Rig:

Use a Carolina rig setup.



Brands and Models
Chinese Domestic Market (CDM) Rods

Few high-quality CDM spinning rods are available.
The best CDM spinning rod is the 翠鸟 (Kingfisher) from 钓之屋 (Fishing House).
The 游侠 (the larger version of 翠鸟) is not as good.

Example: A 2500S reel on a 游侠 lacks proper rod skewness, affecting casting performance.



Shimano Rods and Reels

Shimano spinning rods and reels are superior in performance.
The reels have features that prevent accidental rolling after opening the bail, allowing you to stop the line with your finger for better control.

Reels I&rsquo;ve Used

Shimano Vanquish 2500S (2023 model):

Extremely lightweight and smooth.
Feels almost too slim, raising concerns about durability.
The infinite loop system is excellent.


Shimano Stradic 2500S (2023 model):

Heavier compared to Vanquish.
Handle design is not as comfortable.
Appearance gives a sense of reliability.


Shimano Vanford C2000SHG (2020 model):

Great performance but similar concerns about durability due to plastic components.
Feels less robust than the Stradic but is lighter.



Price Comparison (in RMB)

钓之屋 翠鸟 (Kingfisher): 360
Shimano Stradic: 900
Shimano Vanford: 1,100
Shimano Vanquish: 2,600
Shimano Stella: 3,800

Conclusion
Choosing the right fishing gear is crucial for an enjoyable and successful fishing experience. By considering the rod action, reel type and size, line selection, and the right rigs, you can optimize your setup for the best performance. While high-end brands like Shimano offer top-quality equipment, there are also cost-effective options available. Remember to prioritize what suits your fishing style and comfort."><meta name=author content="Jack Yu"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.minifish.org/posts/fishing-gears/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.minifish.org/posts/fishing-gears/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-G0H8JF722Y"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-G0H8JF722Y")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.minifish.org/posts/fishing-gears/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mini Fish"><meta property="og:title" content="How to Choose the Right Fishing Gear: Tips from My Fishing Experiences"><meta property="og:description" content="Note: All prices mentioned are in RMB.

Choosing the appropriate rod, reel, line, and lure can significantly impact your fishing success. In this blog, I want to share my insights to help you make informed decisions when selecting fishing equipment.</p><h2 id=rod-selection>Rod Selection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rod-selection>#</a></h2><h3 id=understanding-rod-actions>Understanding Rod Actions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-rod-actions>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>L (Light) Action Rods</strong>:<ul><li>Best for casting lures weighing <strong>4-5g</strong>.</li><li>Ideal for using lures within half of the rod&rsquo;s lure weight range (e.g., for a rod rated <strong>2-7g</strong>, the optimal lure weight is around <strong>4-5g</strong>).</li></ul></li><li><strong>UL (Ultra-Light) Action Rods</strong>:<ul><li>Suitable for casting lures weighing <strong>3g</strong> or less.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=one-piece-vs-multi-piece-rods>One-Piece vs. Multi-Piece Rods<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#one-piece-vs-multi-piece-rods>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>One-Piece Rods</strong>:<ul><li>Offer better sensitivity and casting performance.</li><li>However, they are less portable and harder to transport.</li><li>Not as easy to sell if you decide to upgrade.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Multi-Piece Rods</strong>:<ul><li>More convenient for travel.</li><li>Slight trade-off in sensitivity compared to one-piece rods.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=recommended-action>Recommended Action<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#recommended-action>#</a></h3><ul><li>The <strong>best action</strong> for spinning cast rods is <strong>Light (L)</strong> action.</li></ul><h2 id=reel-selection>Reel Selection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reel-selection>#</a></h2><h3 id=spinning-reels-vs-baitcasting-reels>Spinning Reels vs. Baitcasting Reels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#spinning-reels-vs-baitcasting-reels>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Spinning Reels</strong>:<ul><li>Easier for casting, especially for beginners.</li><li>Better suited for saltwater fishing than baitcasting reels.</li><li>Can use heavier action rods to cast small lures effectively.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Baitcasting Reels</strong>:<ul><li>Look cool and offer precision, but have a steeper learning curve.</li><li>Not as user-friendly for casting light lures.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=reel-size-and-line-compatibility>Reel Size and Line Compatibility<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reel-size-and-line-compatibility>#</a></h3><ul><li>For a <strong>2500S</strong> reel:<ul><li><strong>0.8 PE</strong> line is sufficient.</li><li>Using <strong>0.6 PE</strong> line on a 2500S reel may require too much line to fill the spool.</li></ul></li><li>For a <strong>2000S</strong> reel:<ul><li><strong>0.6 PE</strong> line is appropriate.</li></ul></li><li>It&rsquo;s not common to use PE lines smaller than <strong>0.6</strong>, as they are less widely available.</li></ul><h3 id=light-weight-reels>Light Weight Reels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#light-weight-reels>#</a></h3><ul><li>Always choose <strong>lightweight reels</strong> for better balance and less fatigue during fishing.</li></ul><h2 id=line-selection>Line Selection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#line-selection>#</a></h2><h3 id=pe-line-vs-fluorocarbon>PE Line vs. Fluorocarbon<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pe-line-vs-fluorocarbon>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Casting Difficulty</strong>:<ul><li><strong>1.5 PE</strong> and fluorocarbon lines offer similar casting challenges.</li></ul></li><li><strong>PE Line Advantages</strong>:<ul><li>Thinner diameter for the same strength compared to fluorocarbon.</li><li>Essential for longer casting distances.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoiding Line Connections</strong>:<ul><li>Use a <strong>Carolina rig</strong> to eliminate the need to connect PE line and fluorocarbon leader.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=recommended-lines>Recommended Lines<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#recommended-lines>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>YGK PE Line</strong>:<ul><li>Highly recommended for its quality.</li><li>Performs much better than Sufix lines.</li><li>Consider using <strong>0.6 or 0.8 PE</strong> from YGK.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fluorocarbon Line</strong>:<ul><li><strong>1.5 Fluorocarbon</strong> can be used as a leader if necessary.</li></ul></li></ul><h2

href=#recommendations>#</a></h2><h3 id=final-gear-choices>Final Gear Choices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-gear-choices>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Rod</strong>:<ul><li><strong>L Action Spinning Rod</strong> with multiple pieces for portability.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reel</strong>:<ul><li><strong>2000S or 2500S</strong> spinning reel, prioritize lightweight models.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Line</strong>:<ul><li><strong>0.6 or 0.8 YGK PE line</strong> (lean towards 0.6 for more capacity).</li><li>Optional <strong>1.5 Fluorocarbon</strong>

href=#chinese-domestic-market-cdm-rods>#</a></h3><ul><li>Few high-quality CDM spinning rods are available.</li><li>The best CDM spinning rod is the <strong>翠鸟 (Kingfisher)</strong> from <strong>钓之屋 (Fishing House)</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>游侠</strong> (the larger version of 翠鸟) is not as good.<ul><li>Example: A 2500S reel on a 游侠 lacks proper rod skewness, affecting casting performance.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=shimano-rods-and-reels>Shimano Rods and Reels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shimano-rods-and-reels>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Shimano</strong> spinning rods and reels are superior in performance.</li><li>The reels have features that prevent accidental rolling after opening the bail, allowing you to stop the line with your finger for better control.</li></ul><h4 id=reels-ive-used>Reels I&rsquo;ve Used<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reels-ive-used>#</a></h4><ul><li><strong>Shimano Vanquish 2500S (2023 model)</strong>:<ul><li>Extremely lightweight and smooth.</li><li>Feels almost too slim, raising concerns about durability.</li><li>The infinite loop system is excellent.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shimano Stradic 2500S (2023 model)</strong>:<ul><li>Heavier compared to Vanquish.</li><li>Handle design is not as comfortable.</li><li>Appearance gives a sense of reliability.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shimano Vanford C2000SHG (2020 model)</strong>:<ul><li>Great performance but similar concerns about durability due to plastic components.</li><li>Feels less robust than the Stradic but is lighter.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=price-comparison-in-rmb>Price Comparison (in RMB)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#price-comparison-in-rmb>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>钓之屋 翠鸟 (Kingfisher)</strong>: <strong>360</strong></li><li><strong>Shimano Stradic</strong>: <strong>900</strong></li><li><strong>Shimano Vanford</strong>: <strong>1,100</strong></li><li><strong>Shimano Vanquish</strong>: <strong>2,600</strong></li><li><strong>Shimano Stella</strong>: <strong>3,800</strong></li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>Choosing the right fishing gear is crucial for an enjoyable and successful fishing experience. By considering the rod action, reel type and size, line selection, and the right rigs, you can optimize your setup for the best performance. While high-end brands like Shimano offer top-quality equipment, there are also cost-effective options available. Remember to prioritize what suits your fishing style and comfort.</p><p>Happy fishing!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://blog.minifish.org/posts/vietnam/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Tips for Traveling in Vietnam: My Personal Experiences</span>
