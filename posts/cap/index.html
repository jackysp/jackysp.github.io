  <h1>Understanding the CAP Theorem</h1>
  <time datetime=2017-12-20T22:21:06&#43;0800 class="post-date">Wed, Dec 20, 2017</time>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The CAP theorem has become one of the hottest theorems in recent years; when discussing distributed systems, CAP is inevitably mentioned. However, I feel that I haven&rsquo;t thoroughly understood it, so I wanted to write a blog post to record my understanding. I will update the content as I gain new insights.</p>
<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>
<p>I read the first part of this <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/zh-CN//pubs/archive/45855.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CAP theorem [Bre12] says that you can only have two of the three desirable properties of:</p>
<ul>
<li>C: Consistency, which we can think of as serializability for this discussion;</li>
<li>A: 100% availability, for both reads and updates;</li>
<li>P: tolerance to network partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to three kinds of systems: CA, CP and AP, based on what letter you leave out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me share my understanding, using a network composed of three machines (x, y, and z) as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>C (Consistency)</strong>: The three machines appear as one. Operations of addition, deletion, modification, and query on any one machine should always be consistent. That is, if you read data from x and then read from y, the results are the same. If you write data to x and then read from y, you should also read the newly written data. Wikipedia also specifically mentions that it&rsquo;s acceptable to read the data just written to x from y after a short period of time (eventual consistency).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A (Availability)</strong>: The three machines, as a whole, must always be readable and writable; even if some parts fail, it must be readable and writable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P (Partition Tolerance)</strong>: If the network between x, y, and z is broken, any machine cannot or refuses to provide services; it is neither readable nor writable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <strong>C</strong> is the easiest to understand. The concepts of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are somewhat vague and easy to confuse.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s discuss the three combinations:</p>
<p>If the network between x, y, and z is disconnected:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: Ensure data consistency (<strong>C</strong>). When x writes data, y can read it (<strong>C</strong>). Allow the system to continue providing services—even if only x and y are operational—ensuring it is readable and writable (<strong>A</strong>). We can only tolerate z not providing service; it cannot read or write, nor return incorrect data (losing <strong>P</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CP</strong>: Ensure data consistency (<strong>C</strong>). Allow all three machines to provide services (even if only for reads) (<strong>P</strong>). We can only tolerate that x, y, and z cannot write (losing <strong>A</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Allow all three machines to write (<strong>A</strong>). Allow all three machines to provide services (reads count) (<strong>P</strong>). We can only tolerate that the data written by x and y doesn&rsquo;t reach z; z will return data inconsistent with x and y (losing <strong>C</strong>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CA</strong> is exemplified by Paxos/Raft, which are majority protocols that sacrifice <strong>P</strong>; minority nodes remain completely silent. <strong>CP</strong> represents a read-only system; if a system is read-only, whether there&rsquo;s a network partition doesn&rsquo;t really matter—the tolerance to network partitions is infinitely large. <strong>AP</strong> is suitable for systems that only append and do not update—only inserts, no deletes or updates. Finally, by merging the results together, it can still function.</p>
