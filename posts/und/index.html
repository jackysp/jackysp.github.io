  <h2 id="dynamically-updating-dns-records">Dynamically Updating DNS Records</h2>
<p>The purpose of dynamic updates is pretty simple. As a long-term user of China Unicom&rsquo;s broadband, although Unicom provides a public address, it is essentially a dynamic address, not a fixed one. If you want to access your home devices using an IP address from outside, you need to use dynamic DNS (DDNS).</p>
<p>Many routers come with built-in DDNS functionality, but they mostly wrap the interfaces of the commonly used service providers. These providers generally have a few characteristics: 1. Blocked by the Great Firewall; 2. Not cheap; 3. Domestic providers may have security issues; 4. The company might have gone out of business. Rather than relying on these unreliable services, it&rsquo;s better to write your own script for updating.</p>
<p>Thus, the scripting approach comes into play. Initially, I planned to use Cloudflare, as it is the recommended way. Later, I discovered that my domain provider Namesilo offers an API to update DNS. However, it returns data in XML format, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to parse this with shell scripts.</p>
<p>Then, I thought of using Go. Since this DDNS client would likely be deployed on a router-like device, languages like Python or Java require a runtime environment, and C might need some dynamic libraries to run, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to handle. The fact that Go doesn&rsquo;t require dynamic libraries was a significant advantage. So, I handwrote a tool called <a href="https://github.com/jackysp/und">und</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a DNS record in Namesilo.</li>
<li>Obtain the binary of <code>und</code> suitable for your platform. I only provide binaries for arm64|linux and amd64|three mainstream OS in this case. For other platforms, you&rsquo;ll need to compile it yourself. You can refer to the Makefile.</li>
<li>Generate an API key from Namesilo, then start <code>und</code> according to its usage documentation. You might need to run it in the background, so use <code>nohup</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="github-features-experience">GitHub Features Experience</h2>
<h3 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions</h3>
<p>It feels like a replacement for chaotic third-party CI services. I directly chose the Go option for <code>und</code>. By default, it simply runs <code>go build -v .</code> in Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="release">Release</h3>
<p>I used this feature when releasing TiDB before, but didn&rsquo;t remember to upload/automatically generate binaries. Since TiDB is not something that can run completely with just one component, releasing a single binary doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>
<p>This time, the experience led me to believe:</p>
<ol>
<li>When releasing, tagging is best done directly using the release feature.</li>
<li>After the release, since you can edit it, it&rsquo;s a good time to <code>make</code> each binary and upload them. Based on the Makefile setup, you can generate a version. This is quite an important feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two steps are quite convenient.</p>
