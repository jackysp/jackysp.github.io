Recently, I spent some time exploring Vietnam, and I wanted to share some of my experiences and tips to help fellow travelers make the most of their visit.
Internet Access and Blocked Websites

Slow Access to Twitter: If you&rsquo;re an avid Twitter user, be prepared for slower connection speeds. The platform doesn&rsquo;t perform as well in Vietnam.
Inaccessible Websites: Certain websites are blocked in Vietnam, including:

Medium
Some porn websites


Tip: If you rely on any of these platforms, consider downloading content beforehand or using a VPN to access them during your stay.

Visa Process for Chinese Citizens

E-Visa Conversion: Travelers from China holding an E-Visa need to convert it into a paper visa upon arrival.

Bring Two Photos: Ensure you have two passport-sized photos ready for the visa conversion process.
Carry Cash for Tips: It&rsquo;s customary to offer tips during the visa processing, so have some cash (preferably small denominations) on hand.



Exploring Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City)

City Vibes: Saigon reminded me of a blend between Shanghai and Qingdao.

Cleanliness: While the city is bustling with energy, it&rsquo;s not as clean as Shanghai or Qingdao.


Abundance of Coffee Shops: Vietnam is famous for its coffee culture. You&rsquo;ll find numerous coffee shops on almost every street corner.

Must-Try: Don&rsquo;t miss out on traditional Vietnamese iced coffee (Cà Phê Sữa Đá).



Affordability

Cheaper Than Bangkok: Compared to cities like Bangkok, Saigon is significantly more affordable.

Hotels: Accommodation can be about half the price of equivalent hotels in Bangkok.
General Expenses: Food, transportation, and entertainment are also reasonably priced.



Currency and Payments

Accepted Currencies:

Vietnamese Dong (VND) is the official currency.
US Dollars (USD) are widely accepted and sometimes preferred.
Chinese RMB can be used in some places, but USD is more commonly accepted.


Tip: Carrying USD can be convenient, but always have some local currency for small purchases.

Local Customs and Observations

Clothing Choices: You&rsquo;ll notice many locals wearing long-sleeved clothing and pants, even in hot weather.

Reason: This is to prevent sunburn and protect their skin from the sun.


Hardworking People: The Vietnamese are known for their strong work ethic. Streets are lively with activity from early morning until late at night.
Affordable Goods: Many items, from street food to souvenirs, are priced affordably.
Non-Spicy Cuisine:

Similar to Cantonese Food: The flavors are mild and focus on the freshness of ingredients.
Must-Try Dishes: Pho (noodle soup), Banh Mi (baguette sandwich), and fresh spring rolls.



Final Thoughts
Vietnam offers a captivating blend of cultural experiences, historical sites, and modern attractions. Whether you&rsquo;re sipping coffee in a cozy café, exploring bustling markets, or simply taking in the sights and sounds of the city, there&rsquo;s something for every traveler."><meta name=author content="Jack Yu"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.minifish.org/posts/vietnam/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.minifish.org/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.minifish.org/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.minifish.org/posts/vietnam/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-G0H8JF722Y"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-G0H8JF722Y")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.minifish.org/posts/vietnam/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mini Fish"><meta property="og:title" content="Tips for Traveling in Vietnam: My Personal Experiences"><meta property="og:description" content="Vietnam is a vibrant country with a rich culture, friendly people, and stunning landscapes.
