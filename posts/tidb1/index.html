  <h1>How to Read TiDB Source Code (Part 1)</h1>
  <time datetime=2020-07-06T16:51:00&#43;0800 class="post-date">Mon, Jul 6, 2020</time>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>There are many articles on reading the source code of TiDB, often referred to as <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog-cn/#TiDB-%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB">the &ldquo;Twenty-Four Chapters Scriptures&rdquo;</a>. However, these introductions typically proceed from a macro to a micro perspective. This series attempts to introduce how to read TiDB&rsquo;s source code from an easier angle. The goals we aim to achieve are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable readers to start reading TiDB&rsquo;s code themselves, rather than understanding it passively through pre-written articles.</li>
<li>Provide some common examples of looking into the details of the code, such as examining the scope of a variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>After all, teaching people to fish is better than giving them fish. While the code changes often, the methods remain mostly unchanged.</p>
<p>Why choose TiDB to read?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am not familiar with TiKV or PD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TiDB is the entry point directly interacting with users and is also the most likely to be questioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TiDB can run independently and be debugged. If you want to run some SQL after reading the code to verify your understanding, it can be easily done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A development machine</p>
<p>TiDB is a pure Golang project. It can be conveniently developed on Linux, MacOS, and even Windows. My environment is Windows 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the TiDB source code, available for download at the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb">official repo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> environment, following the official guide is straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goland or IntelliJ IDEA + Golang plugin</p>
<p>I personally feel there&rsquo;s no difference between the two. Why not recommend VSCode + Golang plugin? Mainly because I&rsquo;m used to the JetBrains suite, and indeed commercial software tends to be higher quality than community software. For long-term use, it&rsquo;s recommended to pay for it. Students can use it for free, but need to renew the license every year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="environment-setup">Environment Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After installing the Golang environment, remember to set the GOPATH, which is usually:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200706172327.png" alt="goenv"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TiDB code doesn&rsquo;t need to be developed under the GOPATH, so you can place it anywhere. I usually create a directory called work and throw various codes in there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Goland/IDEA. I use IDEA because I often look at code in other languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open with IDEA, select the tidb directory.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200706174108.png" alt="src"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, IDEA typically prompts you to set up GOROOT and enable Go Modules. Follow the recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The environment setup is now complete.</p>
<h2 id="entry-points">Entry Points</h2>
<p>At the beginning, someone advised me to start with the session package. However, after some experience, I personally feel there are two better entry points: the <code>main</code> function and the <code>dispatch</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="main-function">main Function</h3>
<p>The <code>main</code> function of TiDB can be seen at <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/6b6096f1f18a03d655d04d67a2f21d7fbfca2e3f/tidb-server/main.go#L160">link</a>. You can roughly go through what happens when starting a tidb-server from top to bottom.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200706220211.png" alt="main"></p>
<p>From top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parse flags</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output version information and exit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register store and monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration file check</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialize temporary folders, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set global variables, CPU affinity, log, trace, print server information, set binlog, set monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create store and domain</p>
<p>The <code>createStoreAndDomain</code> method is important, as critical background threads are created here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create server and register stop signal function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the server</p>
<p>Within <code>runServer</code>, the <code>srv.Run()</code> actually brings up the tidb-server.
<img src="/posts/images/20200706221611.png" alt="run">
In the <code>Run()</code> function here, the server continuously listens to network requests, creating a new connection for each new request and using a new goroutine to serve it continually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After this, cleanup work is done when the server needs to stop, ultimately writing out the logs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the entire <code>main</code> function process ends. Through the <code>main</code> function, you can see the complete lifecycle of a server from creation to destruction.</p>
<p>Additionally, with IDEA, you can easily start and debug TiDB. Click on this triangle symbol as shown in the image below:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200706222247.png" alt="run1"></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200706222457.png" alt="run2"></p>
<p>A pop-up with options to run and debug the <code>main</code> function will appear. Essentially, this starts a TiDB with default configurations. TiDB defaults to using mocktikv as the storage engine, so it can be started on a single machine for various testing and validation.</p>
<p>As for how to modify the configuration for starting and debugging, this will be introduced in subsequent articles in the series.</p>
<h3 id="dispatch-function">dispatch Function</h3>
<p>From here, we can proceed further to another suitable entry point function, <code>dispatch</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>dispatch</code> function has several characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Requests coming from clients only enter the <code>dispatch</code> function, meaning from this point onward, user requests are executed. If you set breakpoints here, you can conveniently filter out SQL executed by internal threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From here, various requests are dispatched into different processing logic, ensuring you donâ€™t miss any user requests. It avoids situations like spending significant time reading text protocol code only to find out the user is actually using a binary protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dispatch</code> itself is located at a very early stage, meaning its parameters mostly come directly from the client&rsquo;s initial information. If it&rsquo;s a text protocol, directly reading parameters can parse out the SQL text.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200707150344.png" alt="dispatch1"></p>
<p>At the start, <code>dispatch</code> primarily focuses on obtaining tokens corresponding to the token-limit parameter. Requests that can&rsquo;t get a token won&rsquo;t execute, which explains why you can create many connections but only 1000 SQL executions are allowed simultaneously by default.</p>
<p>Next, we enter the most crucial switch case:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200707150736.png" alt="dispatch2"></p>
<p>These commands are MySQL protocol commands, so it&rsquo;s apparent from here exactly what TiDB implements. For comparison, you can refer to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/text-protocol.html">this link</a> (this link is only for the text protocol). For full details, see the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200707151452.png" alt="dispatch3"></p>
<p>Within <code>dispatch</code>, the most important are <code>mysql.ComQuery</code>, as well as the trio <code>mysql.ComStmtPrepare</code>, <code>mysql.ComStmtExecute</code>, and <code>mysql.ComStmtClose</code>. The latter trio is more frequently used in actual production, hence even more important. In contrast, <code>mysql.ComQuery</code> is generally used only for some simple tests and validations.</p>
<p>Since <code>dispatch</code> is the entry point for interfacing with clients, it can conveniently tally how many requests the database has handled. The so-called QPS derived from monitoring statistics is essentially the number of times this function executes per second. Here arises an issue: in cases like multi-query requests, such as <code>select 1; select 1; select 1;</code>, multiple statements sent together are regarded as a single request by <code>dispatch</code>, but as multiple by clients. While using the binary protocol, some clients prepare a statement, then execute, and finally close it. Seemingly equivalent to executing a single SQL from the client&rsquo;s perspective, the database actually completes three requests.</p>
<p>In summary, usersâ€™ perceived QPS may not necessarily align with the number of <code>dispatch</code> function calls. In later versions, the QPS panel in TiDB&rsquo;s monitoring was changed to CPS, which stands for Commands Per Second, representing the number of commands executed per second.</p>
<p>Looking at the callers of <code>dispatch</code> can also reveal information that helps explain some frequently asked questions:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/20200707154120.png" alt="dispatch4"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An EOF error in <code>dispatch</code> typically means the client has actively disconnected, so there&rsquo;s no need to maintain the database connection, and it is severed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of an undetermined error (indicating a transaction&rsquo;s commit is uncertainâ€”whether it has succeeded or failed needs manual intervention for verification), manual intervention is required immediately, and the connection will be closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If writing binlog fails and <code>ignore-error = false</code>, previously the tidb-server process wouldn&rsquo;t exit but couldn&rsquo;t provide services. Now, the tidb-server will exit directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other <code>dispatch</code> errors, the connection will not be closed, allowing service to continue, but the failure information will be logged as &ldquo;command dispatched failed&rdquo;, which is arguably one of the most critical logs for TiDB.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This concludes the introduction from setting up the environment to finding a reasonable entry point to start reading code. Subsequent posts in the series will cover aspects such as configuration (adjustments, default values), variables (default values, scope, actual range, activation), supported syntax, etc. Stay tuned.</p>
